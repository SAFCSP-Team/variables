# Variables

### Objective

In this project, our main goal is to understand variables in Java.

### Problem
Declare a variable, print its value, and update it.

### Implementation
- Create a float variable named `myVariable` and set its initial value to 2.5.
- Print the variable's value.
- Update the valueof `myVariable` to 5.5.
- Print the value after the update.
- Convert the variable to an integer using casting and print the new value.

```java  
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      /* add your code here */
    }

}
```
